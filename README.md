##  XP Core Values
Throughout our project, we made sure to talk openly and often, sticking to the XP Core Value of Communication. We held regular meetings where everyone could share their thoughts, ask questions, and keep everyone in the loop about what was happening. We also used tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams to chat throughout the day, making it easy to stay connected and support each other.

We also valued Feedback a lot. We encouraged everyone to share their thoughts and ideas, and we regularly checked in with each other to see how things were going. This helped us catch any problems early and make adjustments as needed. Plus, by creating a culture where feedback was seen as helpful rather than critical, we all felt comfortable sharing our thoughts and working together to make the project even better.
